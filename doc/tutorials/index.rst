Tutorials
=========

This page contains more in-depth guides for using kikuchipy. It is broken up into
sections covering specific topics.

For shorter examples, see our :doc:`/examples/index`. For descriptions of
the functions, modules, and objects in kikuchipy, see the :doc:`/reference/index`.

The tutorials are live and available on MyBinder: |Binder|

Reference frames
================

These tutorials cover the relevant reference frames in EBSD and how to determine the
detector-sample geometry, also known as the projection/pattern center (PC).
