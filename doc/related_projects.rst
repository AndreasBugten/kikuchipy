This is a non-exhaustive list of related, open-source projects for analysis of
EBSD data that users of kikuchipy might find useful:

- `HyperSpy <https://hyperspy.org>`__: Python library with tools for multi-dimensional
  data analysis, which kikuchipy builds upon.
- `EMsoft <https://github.com/EMsoft-org/EMsoft>`__: Series of Fortran programs which,
  among numerous other tasks, can dynamically simulate EBSD, Electron Channeling Pattern
  (ECP) and Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) master patterns.
- `orix <https://orix.readthedocs.io>`__: Python library for handling crystal
  orientation mapping data. kikuchipy depends on orix for all operations with vectors,
  rotations and crystal symmetry.
- `diffsims <https://diffsims.readthedocs.io>`__: Python library for simulating
  diffraction. kikuchipy depends on diffsims for handling of reciprocal lattice vectors.
- `pyxem <https://pyxem.readthedocs.io>`__: Python library for multi-dimensional
  diffraction microscopy.
- `MTEX <https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/>`__: Matlab toolbox for analyzing and modeling
  crystallographic textures by means of EBSD or pole figure data.
- `AstroEBSD <https://github.com/benjaminbritton/AstroEBSD>`__: Matlab package with
  indexing tools for EBSD patterns.
- `xcdskd <https://xcdskd.readthedocs.io>`_: Python library with tools for Kikuchi
  Diffraction in the SEM, with example Jupyter Notebooks.
- `OpenXY <https://github.com/BYU-MicrostructureOfMaterials/OpenXY>`_: Matlab tool for
  cross-correlation analysis of EBSD patterns.
- `DefDAP <https://defdap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_: Python package for
  correlating EBSD and high-resolution digital image correlation data.
- `pycotem <https://mompiou.github.io/pycotem/>`_: Python package for working with
  crystal orientations in transmission electron microscopy.
