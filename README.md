*KikuchiPy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.*

The library builds upon the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided
by the [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org/) library. This means that the `EBSD`
class, which has several common methods for processing of EBSD patterns, also
inherits all relevant methods from HyperSpy's `Signal2D` and `Signal` classes.

KikuchiPy is released under the GPL v3 license.
