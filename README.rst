*KikuchiPy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.*

The library builds upon the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided
by the `HyperSpy <https://hyperspy.org>`_ library. This means that the EBSD
class, which has several common methods for processing of EBSD patterns, also
inherits all relevant methods from HyperSpy's Signal2D and `Signal
<https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/tools.html>`_ classes.

Note that the project is in an alpha stage, and there will likely be breaking
changes with each release.

KikuchiPy is released under the GPL v3 license.
